# Breast cancer classification using proteomic data

Using a publicly available proteomic data and supervised machine learning to classify sub-types of breast cancer.

Breast cancer is generally classified into five molecular subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2, Basal-like and Normal. Each one is associated with different prognoses and treatments and therapies. 

This data set contains data from 77 patients with breast cancer, as well as clinical data on the patient, the subtype of cancer that the patient has, and an iTRAQ proteome profile based on a tissue sample from each patient.

I am investigating whether the cancer subtype can be accurately classified using only the proteomic data for each patient, using supervised ML classification.
